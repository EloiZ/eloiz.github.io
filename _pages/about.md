I am a research scientist at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io), an AI research center focused on machine learning and computer vision for automotive applications.
My research focuses on dynamic scene understanding and forecasting, vision and language foundation models, and model explainability.

Before joining Valeo, I completed a Ph.D at Sorbonne Universit√©, on [multi-modal machine learning with language and vision](https://theses.fr/2019SORUS409), under the supervision of [Patrick Gallinari](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/), [Laure Soulier](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/soulier/), and [Benjamin Piwowarski](https://www.piwowarski.fr/). Prior to this, I obtained an MSc from ENS Paris-Saclay ("Master MVA") and Ecole Polytechnique (X2012).
