I am a senior research scientist at [valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io), working on:
- autonomous driving, scene understanding and forecasting, world-models, motion planning
- vision and language, explainability, foundation models

Before joining Valeo, I completed a Ph.D. at Sorbonne Université in 2019 on [multi-modal machine learning with language and vision](https://theses.fr/2019SORUS409), supervised by [Patrick Gallinari](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/), [Laure Soulier](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/soulier/), and [Benjamin Piwowarski](https://www.piwowarski.fr/).

Prior to this, I earned an Engineering Degree from École Polytechnique (X2012) and an MSc from ENS Paris-Saclay ("Master MVA").
