[VaViM and VaVAM](/publications#bartoccioni2025vavim-vavam) and [PPT](/publications#xu2025ppt) are accepted at CoRL Workshops. VaViM is a 1.2B parameter video generative model trained on 1,800+ hours of raw Youtube videos. Its derived video-action model, VaVAM, achieves state-of-the-art results on NeuroNCAP driving benchmark. Pseudo-labeled trajectories can be used to pre-train trajectory prediction models: improved performance, efficiency, and generalization.
